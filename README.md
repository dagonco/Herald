# Herald

A kanban-like board to practice the accessibility principles.

This application has been to practice several of the features provided by the Android framework to make an application more accessible to certain groups.

In `master` there is the raw application. In it you can navigate with Talkback and see the shortcomings of most applications that normally use none of the accessibility features.

The [`accessibility-improvements`](https://github.com/dagonco/Herald/tree/accessibility-improvements) branch is going to detail commit to commit all the changes that I have been introducing to improve accessibility in the app.

I am no expert so many of the changes that I have introduced are totally certain they can be improved at some point.

The mission of this project is to make known the shortcomings that are usually found in the applications we develop. We must become aware and try to develop for everyone equally üòÅ

Have fun!
